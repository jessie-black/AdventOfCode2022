# Given a strategy guide (input file) with the following info:
# COLUMN 1 = what opponent will play (A = Rock, B = Paper, C = Scissors)
# COLUMN 2 = what you should play in response (X = Rock, Y = Paper, Z = Scissors)
# Total score = sum of scores for each round
# Score for round = shape you selected (1=Rock, 2=Paper, 3=Scissors) + score for outcome (0 = lost, 3 = draw, 6 = won)
# What score would you get IF you followed strategy guide?
